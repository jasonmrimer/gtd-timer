# gtd-timer
Global timer to track GTD task completion

###Set a timer duration (default 2-min)
###Set a shortcut (default ⌘ Command + ⌥ Option + T)
###Start clarifying~

There is a productivity method called Getting Things Done. The methodology promotes a processing phase of work. During this phase, the goal is to clarify all inputs into your task environment rather than to work tasks. To stay in a clarifying mindset, you cannot get too deeply absorbed by any given task; therefore, the method recommends a 2-minute timer each new input. The timer starts as soon as one touches a new email, letter, or task. If the task can be achieved within 2 minutes, do it. Otherwise, clarify the action to be done and put it on a task list.

Some people receive dozens or hundreds of emails/inputs per day to clarify—that’s a lot of 2-minute timers! To make it effortless, I want to design a webpage that can restart a timer with a single keystroke or shortcut. The shortcut needs to be available globally to avoid app/context switching. It should also restart with a single press rather than start and start (i.e., two presses). Meanwhile, all those restarts can collect into a database to a show a user how well she abides by the 2-minute rule.
